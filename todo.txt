Implement:
    + Tileset loader
    + last row of Arr2D doesn't need to be complete.
    + Draw effects (compute shaders)
    + draw params
    + Make animations frame based
    - rotate sprites
    - text and fonts
    - arr2d iterator returns tuple (pos, value)
    - Additive drawing

Test:
  - Rotations
  - Shaders
  - Text
